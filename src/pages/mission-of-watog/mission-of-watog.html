      <div class="mb-3">The World Association of Trainees in Obstetrics & Gynecology (WATOG) is a non-profit organization that represents the
        worldwide network of young obstetricians and gynecologists (OB/GYN).</div>

      <div class="mb-3">WATOG’s main mission is to help every OB/GYN trainee worldwide to access the highest level of education, overcome cultural
        and gender barriers and ease contact and exchange between members globally.</div>

      <div class="mb-3">WATOG constantly promotes the foundation and sustainment of OB/GYN trainee associations at national and regional levels.
        In order to achieve this, WATOG encourages and helps trainees’ initiatives but also collaborates with the FIGO and
        other national and regional senior associations to strengthen the connection between young and senior representatives
        of our profession. The final goal is to potentiate the involvement of OB/GYN trainees in global issues pertaining
        to reproductive health care, specifically those of the mother, fetus and newborn but also women’s health care in
        general.</div>
